      We conducted two user testing sessions, each targeting different user
      roles: students and instructors. The evaluation aimed to assess the
      system's usability, performance, user experience, and overall
      effectiveness. During the testing session, several technical issues were
      identified, and potential areas for improvement in both the User Interface
      and collaborative features were highlighted through questionnaires. This
      is reflected in the System Usability Scale (SUS) chart below (Average SUS
      score = 58.92, mean SUS score = 65.00).

      Despite these challenges, the testing affirmed the extensionâ€™s potential.
      Further improvements were made after the testing session based on the
      feedback.
