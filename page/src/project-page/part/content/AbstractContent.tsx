      Peer assessment as a form of collaborative learning can encourage students
      to learn actively and improve their learning progress. Previous research
      has demonstrated the potential of systems that integrate peer assessment
      mechanisms. In this project, we aimed to develop a JupyterLab extension to
      make computational notebooks more usable and engaging for teaching and
      learning introductory programming. We were particularly interested in
      supporting instructors to share and demonstrate coding to students,
      allowing instructors to assess studentsâ€™ notebooks at scale, and
      supporting students to collaboratively write and assess their code. During
      development, we extracted core functionality into separate libraries to
      enhance reusability, including a React quiz UI component library and a Yjs
      extension for handling normalized data. Last but no least, we evaluated
      the system and reached out for user feedback.
